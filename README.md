# Smart Greenhouse as a Cyber-Physical System
Physical components include sensors, heaters, buttons, a water pump, and a roof-lifting motor to maintain optimal greenhouse conditions. Arduino scripts are used to monitor and maintain the temperature, humidity, and soil moisture of the greenhouse. Event-driven programming respond to manual controls. Code was run on an Arduino microcontroller and displayed to an LCD using I2C protocol.

Note: The original codebase is on a bricked computer and is yet to be recovered. This includes a PHP file that provides remote access to the greenhouse. This file will be uploaded at a later date when recovered.  The author now knows to regularly backup their code.
